"keeptesting: how to auto-test anything"

"I regularly use TDD for development, and when I do so I enjoy
autotesting. Don't want to use different tools for each
language/platform, scenario, since underlying process is the same:
run tests from shell, run on each file change, react to change to/from test failure"
