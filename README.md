DESCRIPTION:
===========

The simplest way to autotest your code - no matter what language or
framework you use.

Run it from the command line. Specify 1) how tests are launched and 2)
how a failed test looks in the terminal.

The tests will run on every file change in your project - results are
fed back through a pretty html console.

USAGE:
======

PREREQUISITES:
